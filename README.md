## Description
This project introduces a dynamic slicing tool tailored for Python programs, aiding in software debugging and comprehension tasks. By extracting relevant code segments based on user-defined criteria, the tool reduces complexity and facilitates a focused view of program behavior. Leveraging backward program execution analysis, the tool traces program execution from specified points of interest, identifying dependencies and slicing criteria. Through milestones, the tool's development progressed from environment setup to refinement, with a focus on parsing, dependency tracking, and testing. While the tool demonstrates promising results, it faces limitations in language support and handling dynamic features. Overall, the dynamic slicing tool offers a valuable approach to enhance program analysis and debugging, with future work aimed at addressing limitations and enhancing capabilities.
